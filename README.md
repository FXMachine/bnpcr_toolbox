## Package Organization and Documentation

Summary of BNP Covariance Regression package contents:

BNP_covreg.m:
  Main inference script for running the sampler without missing data
  or imputing the missing values.
BNP_covreg_varinds.m:
  Main inference script for running the sampler with analytic marginalization
  of missing values.
runstuff_BNPcovreg.m and runstuff_var_inds_flu.m: see below for explanation

/utilities:
  Script SIMplots.m contains an example of how to process and visualize
  the results from the stored samples.

## Setup and Usage Examples

For an example of running the sampler without missing data or imputing
the missing values, see runstuff_BNPcovreg.m.  This script examines a
synthetic data example.

For an example of running the sampler with analytic marginalization of
missing values, see runstuff_varinds_flu.m.  This script examines the
Google Flu Trends dataset.
